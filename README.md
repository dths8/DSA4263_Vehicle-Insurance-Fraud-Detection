  <em>Machine Learning for Detecting Fraudulent Insurance Claim Cases</em> <br>
</p>

# Project Overview
Insurance fraud remains a persistent challenge that costs the industry billions of dollars each year and undermines the integrity of legitimate claims. Fraudulent activities, such as false claims, exaggerated losses, or coordinated fraud rings, not only lead to financial losses but also increase premiums for honest policyholders and erode trust in insurers.

Traditional fraud detection in insurance often relies on manual reviews or rule-based systems. While these methods can identify obvious cases, they struggle with new and complex fraud patterns that evolve over time. Static rules can result in missed fraud cases or excessive false positives, both of which reduce operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

This project explores the application of machine learning methods to transform fraud detection in the insurance sector by leveraging data-driven insights. Our goal is to build a more intelligent fraud detection system that enhances accuracy, reduces manual workload, and safeguards both insurers and customers.
